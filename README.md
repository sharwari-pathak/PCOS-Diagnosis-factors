📢 🩸 PCOS Risk Factor Dashboard (Tableau + Statistical Modeling)
Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a data analysis project that’s both technically enriching and personally meaningful: understanding the risk factors behind Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) — a condition affecting millions of women worldwide.
🧠 Why I did this:
As someone passionate about applying analytics in healthcare, I wanted to explore how data could uncover patterns in PCOS diagnosis. Using a medical dataset of near about 1000 patient records from Kaggle, I set out to visualize and statistically analyze the impact of various biological indicators.
📊 How I built it:
Designed a fully interactive Tableau dashboard from scratch
Conducted a correlation analysis and a Decision Tree model for feature importance
Focused on variables like BMI, testosterone levels, age, follicle count, and menstrual irregularity
Highlighted both medical trends and statistical insights to make the dashboard actionable
🔍 What I found:
BMI emerged as the top predictor for PCOS (37.6% importance)
Menstrual irregularities were significantly more common in PCOS cases
A visible trend between high testosterone levels and higher BMI among diagnosed patients
PCOS prevalence in the dataset was approximately 19.9%
📈 Key takeaway:
Combining medical data with visual analytics helped me understand not just the “what,” but the “why” behind PCOS trends — reinforcing the role of data storytelling in healthcare insights.
